    "=============================\n",
    "This is my attempt at the Kaggle Competition [Finding Elo](http://www.kaggle.com/c/finding-elo). As the title suggests, we are given records of 50000 chess games. 25000 of those records have the FIDE Elo ratings of the two players each. And the other 25000 records are missing the Elo ratings of the players. Those Elo ratings are for us to predict based on the moves played (given in the game records) and the 25000 training records.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our convenience Kaggle also passed all the games through a very powerful chess engine(stockfish) which analyses the board after each move and measures the strength of the board (i.e. how much the board is in white's favor). We have that data available in a separate csv file.\n",

    "### Converting Board Scores to Features\n",
    "Points to note with board scores are...\n",
    "- We are trying to predict two Elo scores, white player's and black player's. But we have one series of board strengths. For each move by a white player(or black player), the quality of that move is signified by how much that score improves the board score. One way to compute that is the difference between the score before that particular move and after. So we should convert the score series into a series of differences between consecutive scores.\n",
    "- The two consecutive numbers in this new series of score differences, two consecutive numbers will denote performance of opposite players, thus the move quality of a white player's moves and black players moves are interleaved and should be separated.\n",
    "- The length of move series could be indefinitely long or extremely short (even zero moves in case of forfeiture)\n",
    "- Because the length of the series is variable(and for other intuitive reasons) making each move's score a separate feature won't work. What we need to do is figure out the overall performance of a player based on the performance of all his moves(we can also use the performance of the opposite player as a hint to what he was up against)\n",
    "- One way to transform the series of move performances into overall performance is to do statistical analysis on the series. `scipy.stats.describe` provides a convenient way to transform the series into a set of features which all give useful info about the player's performance. The values returned are number-of-moves, min, max, mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis. Now we have a fixed number of features for all the games. Some of these features are obviously interesting...\n",
    "  - mean: this will tell us the average performance of the player which obviously can tell us how well he can play.\n",
    "  - variance: this will point to the consistency of player. Is he all over the place or is consistently performing better\n",
    "  - skewness: this feature should tell us whether a few good moves by fluke are tipping the scale for any player.\n",
    "- In case of forfeiture, we really don't have any data to go by, and I think our best bet is to just predict the average score and hope for the best, further, the training data from forfeiture games could mess with prediction of other games, so we should take out those records from the training data and treat forfeitures completely separately.\n",
    "- In case of draws we can use the difference in number of moves between white player and black player(or total_moves%2) to decide who offered the draw, which could be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Refinements to the Feature Matrix and the Model\n",
    "I've implemented the following refinements...\n",
    "- Added some 2nd degree features by multiplying the number of observation with the other features\n",
    "- Split the model into three outcome based datasets (white wins, black wins, draw)\n",
    "These two improvements(and a bug fix) combined gave a slight boost to the performance jump of around 22 percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Parsing stockfish.csv series\n",
    "For the most part stockfish data is just a series of space separated integers, so very easy to parse. But we have to take care of a couple of edge cases.\n",
    "- In forfeiture games where only white player makes one move and the black player doesn't show up or when white player doesn't show up, we get an empty series, which needs to be explicitly converted to a series of just one move.\n",
    "- Another edge case is, when the game goes into check-mate or when there's only one legal move(a king trying to run and hide) the file has `NA` instead of an integer, in which case the previous board strength number is good enough(IMO)"
